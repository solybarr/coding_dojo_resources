# coding_dojo_resources
Resources taken from platform and Online students Jan 2017

## General Info
This is a proposed Repo so we can keep the multiple resources given to us during our time at Coding Dojo.

We might need help from Jonathan and Alan to keep the chaos out. 

I think this might be a fun (?) way for us to test forking/cloning/pull requests, etc.


### Style Guide
I've made a couple of sample pages.  
The main one platform_references.md will have the links we find as we progress through the platform lessons.

A lot of us already have fave sites and resources, so Ive added the other pages HTML.md, CSS.md, etc. so we can add our links there and I'm sure they will add up fast, that's why I divided it.

I used markdown to format this one page, below a fast guide to that.


ANY SUGGESTIONS WELCOME!
